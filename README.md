## _Description_

**Combat game** between two players both starting with **100 _Health_**, <br />
random **defense** between _10-15_, a random **attack power** between _15-20_, <br />
and a random **shield** between _10-20_ which lowers the **attack power** of the opponent.

Each player has **_25%_** chances to activate a random ability:

- **split damage** from the other player;
- **increase attack** power by **_50%_**;
- **health** increase by **_5%_** if it goes below **_30_**;
- **freeze attack** to cancel opponent hit;
- **demolish** to reduce opponent **Health** by **_50%_**;
- **double attack** to increase attack by **_100%_**;

The first one to attack is picked randomly and both players are changing their roles every round.
